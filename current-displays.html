        <p>Sterling Smith is a Canadian artist based out of Calgary, Alberta. Inspired by the pandemic lockdowns, he picked up a can of spray paint and started creating. Since then, he has been exploring the world of geometric art while trying to push the boundaries of perspective and angles.</p>
        <p>Working primarily with spray paint and acrylic paint on canvas or wood panel, Sterling’s pieces are a stunning display of vibrant colours and sharp lines. His art has been featured in various exhibitions, including the 2022 YYC BUMP Roadworks program as well as various smaller art shows throughout the City of Calgary.</p>
        <p>Sterling had a large installation at Una Pizza + Wine on 17th Ave SW in Calgary, AB for the summer months totalling over 100 square feet. Sterling collaborated with an eye wear company in Alberta, Good Day Optics, to create a limited edition ski goggle strap. Sterling has also started a commission list that has gained popularity in recent months.</p>
        <p>Sterling’s main goal for creating art is to transport the viewer into a colourful, geometric world where colours pop and interact to give a sense of playfulness. Sterling hopes to inspire viewers of his art to be creative and to explore colour and perspective in their own lives!</p>
        <p>Please give Sterling a follow on social media and feel free to reach out directly through DM or email if you have any questions or interests about his art.</p>
